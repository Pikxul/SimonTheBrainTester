var buttonColours = ["red","blue","green","yellow"]; - This line creates an array of colors that will be used in the game.


var gamePattern = []; - This line creates an empty array to store the sequence of colors that the game will generate.


var userClickedPattern = []; - This line creates another empty array to store the sequence of colors that the user clicks.


var started = false; - This line creates a variable to keep track of whether the game has started or not.


var level = 0; - This line creates a variable to keep track of the current level.


The next block of code is a jQuery event handler that listens for a keypress event on the document object. 
When a key is pressed and the game hasn't started yet, it starts the game by calling the nextSequence function and setting the started variable to true.


The next block of code is a jQuery event handler that listens for a click event on any element with the class btn.
When a button is clicked, it gets the ID of the clicked button (which should correspond to a color), 
pushes it to the userClickedPattern array, plays a sound, animates the button press, and checks the user's answer.


The checkAnswer function checks if the user's answer matches the game's sequence at the current level. 
If it does, and the user has completed the current sequence, it waits for a second and then generates the next sequence. 
If the user's answer is incorrect, it plays a "wrong" sound, adds a "game-over" class to the body, updates the level title, 
waits for 200 milliseconds, removes the "game-over" class, and restarts the game.


The nextSequence function resets the userClickedPattern array, increments the level, 
updates the level title, generates a random number between 0 and 3, uses this number to select a random color from the buttonColours array, 
pushes this color to the gamePattern array, fades the corresponding button in and out, and plays a sound for the chosen color.


The animatePress function adds a "pressed" class to the clicked button, waits for 100 milliseconds, and then removes the "pressed" class.


The playSound function creates a new Audio object with the specified sound file, and plays the sound.


The startOver function resets the level, gamePattern array, and started variable to their initial values.
